            <h3>Monthly FAB BAG Beauty & Grooming Subscriptions</h3>
            <h4>1 . For Products Damaged in Transit:</h4>
            <p>Before each FAB BAG is shipped, we do several levels of rigorous quality checks to eliminate the chances of a damaged product being shipped. In the rare event that a product from your monthly FAB BAG is accidentally damaged in transit, we will happily replace it with another piece of the same. Please note that the issue has to be communicated to us within 48 hours of delivery of your FAB BAG via an email to crew@fabbag.com with a picture of the damaged product. We require this to source a replacement from our brand partners that we then ship out to you.</p>
 <br>
            <h4>2 . Address Change Requests Ongoing Subscriptions:</h4>
            
     <p> We accept address changes for a month's FAB BAG before 25th of the previous month. For timely shipping and operational reasons, we will not be able to accept any address changes after this date as your bag would have already been processed. If you are unlikely to be available at the address on record, you can drop in a request for us to hold your shipment and ship it out with the next month's delivery. In case your order has left our warehouse reshipping service charge of INR 100 will be applicable for address change after the timeline specified.:</p>
    
     <h4>3 . New Subscriptions: </h4>
     
           
     <p>Address changes for new subscription should be updated via email within 48 hours of the order placed. Please send us an email to crew@fabbag.com with the details of your new address for us to make the change.</p>
     
     <h4>4 . Makeup/Shade/Product Selection:</h4><p>
        Depending on our monthly curation, you should be able to pick a product in your Fab Bag.
     </p>
     <p>If you are our On-Going Subscriber, the choice will be made available in the 4th week of the month for your upcoming Fab Bag. In case of New Subscriptions, the choice will be available on the Order Confirmation Page. If you missed selecting your product on the Order Confirmation Page or cannot find the link, you can head to My Account > Orders History to make your selection.
        Selection once made cannot be changed. If you miss out on selecting Makeup for the month within 48 hours or the deadline otherwise specified, the product will be customized by the FAB BAG Crew based on the preference youâ€™ve listed in your Beauty Profile.</p>
